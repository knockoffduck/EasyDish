So here's another super easy Sunday slow cooker meal for you.
So we are gonna get our 1KG chicken,
slap that bad boy in there,
have your tikka masala sauce and slap that whole thing in there
alright, now we're gonna get our light coconut cream
and we're gonna put the whole lot of that in there as well.
So one thing I'm doing differently with this one
compared to most of my slow cooker meals
is adding a little bit of veggies
just for volume because we can add this in
it's fuck all calories but it's gonna keep you a lot fuller for longer.
I've chopped in 400 grams of carrot and half a white onion.
We're gonna put that on low for four to six hours
and I'll come back when it's done.
So we are back.
It is been about seven hours and fucking have a look at that.
Best fucking thing about using a slow cooker for your meal prep
is not only does it take no fucking time
cause I've been out all day and it's done but it stays fresh.
It's nice 4, 5 days later.
